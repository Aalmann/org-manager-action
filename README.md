# org-manager-action

This Action is useful when you like org management as code.
It is written in python and implemented as alternative to the terraform github provider.

## Why no just using terraform github provider?

There are several reasons, but the most important ones are:

1. A GitHub workflow which sets up Terraform and runs `plan` and `apply` and everything else needs some minutes.
2. There is no good way in Terraform to read back manual changes which will defenitely occure and which have to be handled with additional scripts and programs.
3. Not all of us are familar with Terraform. Of course one can learn it, it's not that hard. But if you are not interessted, have a look at this action.
